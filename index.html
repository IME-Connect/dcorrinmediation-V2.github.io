            <h2>Daniel F. Corrin</h2>
            <p class="about-subhead">Mediator &amp; Arbitrator</p>
            <p>
              Daniel Corrin is a highly experienced personal injury lawyer with more than 20 years of legal
              experience in complex injury and dispute resolution matters. His practice is grounded in a deep
              understanding of both the legal system and the human impact of serious conflict, allowing him to
              guide parties toward thoughtful, practical, and lasting resolutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before moving towards dispute resolution as a mediator &amp; arbitrator, Daniel was a principal
              lawyer at Parsons Corrin LLP, where he built a distinguished career in catastrophic injury
              litigation. He has extensive trial experience involving mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain
              injuries, spinal cord injuries, medical malpractice, and complex motor vehicle claims. Many of the
              cases he led resulted in multi-million-dollar judgments, giving him a clear, firsthand understanding
              of litigation risk, evidentiary challenges, and the costs—financial and personal—of prolonged
              disputes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Daniel’s mediation and arbitration work is informed by decades of engagement with the brain injury,
              legal, and medical communities. He has served in advisory roles with community brain injury
              organizations across British Columbia, volunteered legal services, and remained deeply involved in
              education and professional development within the legal field. He served for over a decade on the
              Board of the Trial Lawyers Association of BC (TLABC) and has chaired and organized numerous legal
              conferences focused on injury law, medical-legal issues, and complex dispute resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              A frequent speaker and educator, Daniel has presented at leading national and international
              conferences, including the International Mental Health and the Law conferences in Rome and Prague,
              as well as professional forums at Vancouver General Hospital, GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre, and
              the Pacific Coast Brain Injury Conference. He has written extensively on legal and medical-legal
              issues and was an author of the Continuing Legal Education British Columbia Motor Vehicle Accident
              Claims Practice Manual.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a mediator and arbitrator, Daniel brings a calm, structured, and empathetic approach to dispute
              resolution. He is known for his ability to listen carefully, understand the underlying interests of
              all parties, and help participants move beyond entrenched positions toward fair and workable
              outcomes. His years of direct engagement with injured individuals, families, professionals, and
              insurers have shaped a dispute resolution style that is respectful, informed, and deeply human.
